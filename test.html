Andy Tsege is a British citizen, father of three children and a democracy campaigner. He called for democratic change in Ethiopia and was sentenced to death by the regime while he was living in London with his family.

Two years ago he was kidnapped from an international airport and dragged to an Ethiopian secret prison. He has been held ever since under sentence of death.

130,000 people have signed a petition calling on the British government to demand Andy’s release. The UN and EU have called for the same. Andy’s family, Reprieve and thousands of British people have written to the UK government.

<strong>Below is Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond’s response – just click <span class="highlight">each line highlighted in orange</span> to reveal the 5 reasons why he is wrong not to demand Andy’s release. If you agree, just click to tweet at Hammond – you can tweet one or all five.</strong>

Dear Ms Foa,

I am writing in regards to the various letters and emails referencing Reprieve that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has received from members of the public concerning the case of British national, Andargachew Tsege, currently detained in Ethiopia.

<a name="number1return"></a>
<p style="display: inline;">Please be assured that the British Government takes Mr Tsege's welfare very seriously. I raised his case with both the Ethiopian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister during my visit to Ethiopia on 1 June 2016. During my meetings, I made it clear that while progress has been made, with regular consular access now in place following his transfer to a federal prison, further steps are required. Prime Minister Hailemariam assured me that <span class="highlight title1">Mr Tsege will be allowed to access to independent legal advice</span></p>

<div class="mobile-tooltip mobile-tooltip-1">
<h3><strong>1. There is no lawful conviction for a lawyer to appeal nor legal process to challenge. Andy’s kidnap was illegal, his death sentence was illegal, and his ongoing detention is illegal.</strong></h3>
Andy was tried by the Ethiopian authorities three times in absentia, meaning that he wasn’t even in the courtroom – he was thousands of miles away in London when he was sentenced to death. UN experts have clearly stated that Andy’s convictions are unlawful and do not constitute a legitimate basis for his detention. <sup>[1]</sup>

If the Ethiopian authorities wanted to follow legal process, they would have requested Andy's extradition from the UK. Instead they gave him an unlawful death sentence and then kidnapped him when he was transiting though an international airport. <sup>[2]</sup>

Andy was never formally notified of the proceedings. He was never given the opportunity to get a lawyer or present a defence. He was never given the details of the charges against him.
<blockquote><em>“Lacking in basic elements of due process” <sup>[5]</sup> , and a form of “political retaliation”.<sup>[6]</sup></em>
– US diplomats describing Andy’s widely criticised 2009 death sentence</blockquote>

<h3><strong>3. The UK should request Andy's release from unlawful captivity. 130,000 people have signed a petition calling on the UK government to do so, and thousands more have written to their MPs.</strong></h3>
Andy is a victim of crime, not a criminal. He was kidnapped by the Ethiopian government and illegally rendered to a country he fled as a political refugee. For over a year, he was held in solitary confinement at a secret location. He is now in legal limbo in a Federal Prison – he has no prisoner number and the authorities continue to deny that he is in their custody at all.

The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention <sup>[7]</sup>, the European Parliament<sup>[8]</sup> and thousands of British people have called for Andy’s release. The only appropriate response to these grave human rights abuses is for the British government to do the same.

<h3><strong>4. Requesting the release of a British citizen held illegally is not ‘interfering’. It is simply not true that the UK does not request the release of citizens illegally detained in other countries.</strong></h3>
The British Government has intervened many times to demand the release of British (or other) nationals. The UK requested the release of every Brit detained at Guantánamo Bay. Philip Hammond himself secured the release of British national Karl Andree from Saudi Arabia in 2015 during a visit to that country.<sup>[9]</sup>

</div><p style="display: inline;"> any more than we would accept interference in our judicial system, although we do lobby strongly and consistently against the application of the death penalty, and against the carrying out of such sentences when they are imposed. Our consular priority at this time is to ensure Mr Tsege's well-being and access to legal advice, and to ensure that the death sentence is not carried out.</p>
<a name="number3return"></a>
<p style="display: inline;">During my visit, a senior Foreign Office official travelling with me was, at my request, given access to Mr Tsege in prison. This was the tenth visit to Mr Tsege by British Government officials. Following that visit, <span class="highlight title5">I am satisfied that he is not being ill-treated</span></p><div class="mobile-tooltip mobile-tooltip-5">
<h3><strong>5. Experts agree that Andy has been tortured.</strong></h3>
The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office has stated that it is “addressing what are prima facie signs of mistreatment” in Andy’s case.

In March 2016, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture concluded that Ethiopia had violated the Convention Against Torture in “subjecting Mr. Tsege to torture, ill-treatment, prolonged solitary confinement and incommunicado detention”.<sup>[10]</sup>

The Convention Against Torture, to which the UK and Ethiopia are both signatories, obliges the UK government to investigate all allegations of torture. No evidence been shown to support Philip Hammond’s conclusion that Andy is not being “ill-treated”.

Andy Tsege is British citizen, father of three children and a prominent democracy campaigner. He loudly opposed the Ethiopian regime, even speaking out about its poor human rights record in front of US Congress and the EU’s Committee on Human Rights.

In an act described as ‘political retaliation’, the regime sentenced Andy to death in 2009, but he was safely living in London with his family at the time.

<img class="alignright wp-image-7797 size-medium" src="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016_02_09_PUB-Tsege-kids-delivering-petition-5-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201" />Two years ago the authorities kidnapped Andy from an international airport. He was dragged to an Ethiopian secret prison as part of a brutal crackdown on opposition activists to face his in absentia death sentence. Since then, Andy has been paraded on Ethiopian TV looking ill and showing signs of torture – he was shown ‘confessing’ to various crimes, with screaming clearly audible in the background.

130,000 people have signed a petition calling on the British government to demand Andy’s release. Andy’s family and thousands of British people have also written to their MPs and to the government.
